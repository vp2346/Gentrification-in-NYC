#CONSTIT Abbreviation indicating constituent type.  Values include NO3+NO2: nitrate plus nitrite as N; TN: total nitrogen as N; TP: total phosphorus as P; SSC: suspended-sediment concentration
#WY Water year; the 12-month period beginning on October 1 for any given year and lasting through September 30 of the following year. The water year is designated by the calendar year in which it ends.
#MODTYPE The type of model used to compute load values.  Values include "COMP" indicating the composite method; "CONTIN" indicating loads were computed through the use of continuous nitrate data; "DAILY" indicated data were computed using daily values (SSC only); REG indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website using a 5-year moving window; "REG_2; REG_3; REG_4" indicating models were computed using regression methods described in the technical information portion of the website but with a 2 3 or 4-year moving windows (respectively) as opposed to a 5-year moving window; "REG_PRELIM" indicating that a model was developed using data collecting during the initial 2-4 years in which a site was sampled; models at these sites will continue to be updated until 5 years of data are collected; and "REGHIST" indicating that models were historically computed according to procedures described in Aulenbach and others (2007)
#TONS Load in tons
#TONS_L95 Lower 95% confidence interval of the water-quality load in tons
#TONS_U95 Upper 95% confidence interval of the water-quality load in tons
#FWC Annual flow-weighted concentrations in milligrams per liter
#YIELD  Yield in tons per square mile
