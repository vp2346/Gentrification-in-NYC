# Water_contaminant_in_US

This project was inspired by reports of high levels of lead in drinking water in Flint, Michigan and Newark, New Jersey. Our report has shown that there are many other sources of contamination in drinking water, regulated and unregulated, and that these pollutants are found in a number of drinking water sources throughout the United States. We hope that our presentation inspires future research. We also hope that it motivates its readers to think critically about where they get their drinking water from and to hold officials accountable for providing clean drinking water, regardless of where in the world our readers live.

In this project, we used maps, Trellis plots and Sankey diagrams to visualize regulated and unregulated contaminant in U.S drinking water supply.
